// Currently the CompilationOptions type in Roslyn in sealed and there's no way to set the compilation options for a project.
// There's no property bag on a project either. So this service is a means to get the host project for a given Roslyn project
// so that extra F# specific information can be stored on the host project.
// Note that the FSharpProject is available only through the VS Workspace although we might call this service from projects of 
// some other workspace like the PreviewWorkspace.
